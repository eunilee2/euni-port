                            <p>Alex and Mark Heimann, the founders of Roi du Pain, envisioned an online express bakery that ships fresh-baked goods within a day. However, they needed a robust, end-to-end e-commerce system to manage customer accounts, daily baking and shipping workflows, and administrative oversightâ€”without the overhead of expensive software development. They required a platform that would not only allow customers to browse and purchase products online but also streamline backend operations such as baking preparation, order packing, and delivery scheduling. The complexity of user roles (customers, bakers, shippers, and managers), combined with inventory handling, price tracking, and secure authentication, posed a considerable challenge for a first build.</p>

                            <p>We developed a full-stack web application using Ruby on Rails 7.0.4 and Ruby 3.1.4 to support a scalable and role-driven bakery ordering system. The application enables customers to register, manage accounts and addresses, place orders, and view order histories. For the operational staff, it provides automatically generated daily baking and shipping lists, while managers are equipped with a dashboard to monitor and manage all facets of the business. The system also supports role-based authentication and authorization, encoded payment records, and flexible pricing models with historical tracking. Key user-facing views were designed using MaterializeCSS to ensure clarity, accessibility, and responsiveness.</p>

                            <p>
                                This project taught me how to build a comprehensive Rails application from the ground up, while practicing best practices in MVC architecture, test-driven development, and modular service design. One of the most rewarding aspects was seeing how well-defined unit and integration tests could guide the development of both backend logic and user interfaces. It also underscored the importance of clean organization, especially in large team environments where context setup and refactoring play major roles in code clarity.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                By handling both customer-facing and internal administrative roles, I gained valuable insight into how different system users interact with the same dataset in unique ways. The iterative checkpoints ensured continual progress, and the constraints (like simulated payments and shipping caps) helped isolate and master key components without overwhelming scope creep. I feel more confident in tackling future full-stack projects with complex requirements, particularly in domains that intersect commerce, logistics, and role-based system management.
